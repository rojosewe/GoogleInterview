7.2 There are three ants on different vertices of a triangle. What is the probability of
collision (between any two or all of them) if they start walking on the sides of the
triangle? Assume that each ant randomly picks a direction, with either direction
being equally likely to be chosen, and that they walk at the same speed.
Similarly, find the probability of collision with n ants on an n-vertex polygon.

left p = 0.5
right q= 0.5

Chance of them walking all t the same side:
p * p* p = 0.125
q* q* q= 0.125
ppp + qqq = 0.25

All other options result in a collision:
 p colision = 0.75

probability of non collission p^n + q^n
probability of collision 1 - ( p^n + q^n )
